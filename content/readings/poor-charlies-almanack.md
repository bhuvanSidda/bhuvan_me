Charlie Munger is Warren Buffett's partner at Berkshire Hathaway and arguably the more interesting thinker of the two. This book collects his speeches, talks, and the famous "mental models" framework that has influenced a generation of investors and thinkers.

## The Mental Models Approach

Munger's core insight: you need a latticework of mental models from multiple disciplines to think clearly about the world. Psychology, physics, biology, economics, mathematics — each provides tools that the others lack.

The most dangerous thing is to have only one model. "To a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail."

## Key Mental Models

- **Inversion**: Instead of asking "How do I succeed?", ask "How would I certainly fail?" Then avoid those things.
- **Circle of Competence**: Know what you know. More importantly, know what you don't know. Stay within your circle.
- **Second-Order Thinking**: Consider not just the immediate effect, but the effect of the effect. Most people stop at first-order.
- **Margin of Safety**: Always leave room for error. In investing, in engineering, in life.

## On Character

What makes this book special isn't the investing wisdom — it's the emphasis on character. Munger insists that the best way to get what you want in life is to deserve it. Be reliable. Be ethical. Do what you say you'll do.

## Still Reading

I'm partway through the collected speeches. Each one rewards careful, slow reading. This is not a book you rush through.
