This isn't a traditional book — it's a curated collection of Naval Ravikant's tweets, podcast transcripts, and essays, assembled by Eric Jorgenson. And yet it might be the most important book on wealth and happiness written in the last decade.

## Key Ideas

**Specific knowledge** is knowledge that cannot be trained for. It's found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion rather than whatever is hot right now. If it can be taught in a classroom, someone else can learn it and compete with you.

**Leverage** comes in three forms: labor (people working for you), capital (money working for you), and products with no marginal cost of replication (code and media). The last form is the most democratic — you don't need anyone's permission to write code or create content.

**Happiness is a skill** you can develop, not a destination you arrive at. Naval's framework: happiness = health + wealth + good relationships - wanting things you don't have.

## What Stuck With Me

The idea that stuck most: *"Earn with your mind, not your time."* Building leverage through code, writing, and capital means your income becomes disconnected from the hours you put in. This is the fundamental shift that separates linear careers from exponential ones.

## Verdict

Essential reading. Short enough to finish in an afternoon, deep enough to revisit for years.
