Dear Partners,

2025 was a year of disciplined execution. While markets were volatile, our focus on quality businesses with durable competitive advantages served us well.

## Performance

Our portfolio delivered strong risk-adjusted returns, driven by our core holdings in infrastructure, technology, and healthcare. We remained patient during periods of volatility and took advantage of dislocations to add to our highest-conviction positions.

## Portfolio Positioning

We continue to favor:

1. **Quality compounders** — businesses with high returns on capital, strong moats, and capable management teams
2. **Infrastructure** — essential assets that benefit from secular tailwinds
3. **Selective technology** — companies with real revenue, real margins, and real competitive advantages

## Outlook

We enter 2026 with cautious optimism. Valuations in certain segments remain stretched, but our bottom-up approach continues to uncover opportunities. We are patient and will deploy capital when the risk-reward is compelling.

Thank you for your continued trust and partnership.

Respectfully,

BD Sterling Capital Management
