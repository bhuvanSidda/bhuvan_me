title: "About BD Sterling Capital Management"
---

BD Sterling Capital Management is a research-driven investment firm focused on long-term value creation through disciplined capital allocation.

## Philosophy

We believe in:

- **Long-term thinking** — We measure our performance in years, not quarters
- **Quality over quantity** — We concentrate our capital in our highest-conviction ideas
- **Margin of safety** — We buy businesses at prices that provide a margin of safety
- **Intellectual honesty** — We rigorously challenge our own assumptions

## Approach

Our investment process combines deep fundamental research with a macro-aware perspective. We look for businesses with durable competitive advantages, excellent management teams, and attractive valuations.

We are patient capital. We are willing to hold cash when opportunities are scarce and deploy aggressively when the market presents dislocations.
