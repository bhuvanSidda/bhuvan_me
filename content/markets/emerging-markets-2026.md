For the past decade, the trade has been simple: own US large-cap tech and ignore everything else. That trade has worked spectacularly. But the best investments are often found where consensus is most negative.

## The Valuation Gap

US equities trade at roughly 22x forward earnings. Emerging markets trade at 12x. This is one of the widest valuation gaps in history. While the US premium is partially justified by higher earnings quality, the current spread implies an extreme level of pessimism about the rest of the world.

## Structural Tailwinds

Several structural tailwinds favor emerging markets:

- **Demographics**: Younger, growing working-age populations in India, Indonesia, and parts of Africa
- **Digital adoption**: Mobile-first economies leapfrogging legacy infrastructure
- **Supply chain diversification**: Companies diversifying manufacturing away from China, benefiting Vietnam, India, and Mexico

## Risks

The risks are real. Currency volatility, political instability, and weaker institutions remain headwinds. China's property overhang and demographic decline are genuine concerns.

But at current valuations, much of this is already priced in. The asymmetry favors a measured allocation to high-quality emerging market businesses trading at single-digit earnings multiples.

## Our Approach

We're not making a macro bet. We're finding individual businesses in emerging markets that would be considered world-class at any valuation — and happen to be trading at significant discounts to their developed-market peers.
