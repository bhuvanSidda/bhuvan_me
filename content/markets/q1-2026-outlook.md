As we enter 2026, the macro landscape is shifting in ways that create both risk and opportunity. Here's what we're watching.

## Interest Rates

The Fed's rate cycle is maturing. We expect one or two more cuts this year, but the pace will be data-dependent. The key question isn't where rates are going, but how quickly the economy adjusts to the new equilibrium.

## AI Infrastructure

The AI infrastructure buildout continues at an extraordinary pace. The companies providing the picks and shovels — semiconductors, cloud infrastructure, energy — remain well-positioned. But valuations are stretched, and the gap between AI winners and losers will widen.

## Where Value Hides

We continue to find value in:
- **Quality compounders** trading at reasonable multiples
- **Infrastructure businesses** with predictable cash flows
- **International markets** that remain significantly cheaper than US equities

The best investments over the next decade will be in businesses that generate real cash flows and allocate capital wisely. Narrative-driven speculation will not compound.
