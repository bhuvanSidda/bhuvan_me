*There Will Be Blood* is not merely a film about the oil industry. It is a study of what happens when ambition becomes untethered from humanity.

## Daniel Plainview

Daniel Day-Lewis delivers what may be the greatest screen performance ever committed to film. His Daniel Plainview is a man of terrifying competence and even more terrifying emptiness. He wants to succeed not because success will bring him joy, but because he "has a competition in him" — he wants others to fail.

## The Architecture of Isolation

Anderson constructs the film like a slow-building earthquake. The vast, empty landscapes mirror Plainview's interior — there is no one in there. His adoption of H.W., his only genuine connection, becomes corrupted by his own inability to be vulnerable.

## Why It Matters

This film matters because it tells the truth about a certain kind of ambition — the kind that builds empires but destroys the builder. Plainview ends the film alone in his mansion, surrounded by wealth, having driven away everyone who ever mattered.

"I'm finished," he says at the end. And he is.

A perfect film.
