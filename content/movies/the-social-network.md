Every generation gets the creation myth it deserves. For ours, it's *The Social Network* — a film about a young man who builds the most connected platform in human history while being fundamentally disconnected from the people around him.

## Sorkin's Script

The screenplay moves like a machine — every line serves double duty, advancing plot while revealing character. The deposition scenes are masterful framing devices, creating dramatic irony at every turn.

## The Ending

The final shot — Zuckerberg alone, refreshing a friend request — is one of the most devastating endings in modern cinema. He built a tool for connection because he couldn't connect. He won everything and lost everything that mattered.

An essential film about the modern world.
