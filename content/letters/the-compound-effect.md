The most powerful force in the universe isn't nuclear fission or gravity — it's compounding. And it applies to far more than money.

Every day you have a choice: improve by 1%, stay the same, or decline by 1%. The differences are invisible day to day. But over a year, a 1% daily improvement makes you 37 times better. A 1% daily decline leaves you at 3% of where you started.

## Applied Compounding

This principle applies to everything:

- **Knowledge**: Reading 20 pages a day is 7,300 pages a year — roughly 25 books.
- **Skills**: One hour of deliberate practice daily is 365 hours a year — enough to become genuinely competent at almost anything.
- **Relationships**: Small consistent gestures compound into deep trust over time.
- **Health**: Small daily habits — walking, sleeping well, eating real food — compound into vitality that no crash diet can match.

## The Catch

The catch is that compounding requires patience. The returns are back-loaded. The first year of anything feels like nothing is happening. The second year, you start to notice. The third year, others start to notice. The tenth year, you're in a completely different universe.

Most people quit in the first year.

Don't be most people.
